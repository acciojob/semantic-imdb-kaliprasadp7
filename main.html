	<summary>Five-year-old Krishna Mehra is the son of scientist, Rohit and his late wife Nisha. He lives in the town of Kasauli. He undergoes an intelligence quotient (IQ) test by his catholic school principal who suspects that Krishna has superpowers like his father, due to Krishna answering all the questions flawlessly. His grandmother, Sonia, takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna meets vacationing friends, Priya Kalyanan and Honey Arora, who both live in Singapore. Krishna's friend Bahadur takes the girls' camping crew, led by Komal Singh, near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a hang glider accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her.</summary>

		Krrish was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert Tony Ching. The music was composed by Rajesh Roshan, with the background score by Salimâ€“Sulaiman. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India.

			Krrish was the first Indian film to be shot in Singapore under the Singapore Tourism Board's Film-in-Singapore subsidy scheme, and over 60% of the film was shot there.[16] Shooting was accomplished on location over a span of 2 months, from September to November 2005.[17] Locations featured included the Singapore Zoo, the Gateway building, and the Singapore National Library.[18] Another major filming location was Robinson Road, where heavy rains caused production delays.[19] The Singapore police were on location to block roads and protect the filming equipment,[19] such as when the film's action scenes required two 250-foot high industrial cranes.[14] Author Audrey Yue noted that the film shoot benefited Singapore by leading to domestic and Indian film-induced tourism.[16]
